    section1: `üîß What is Backend Development?

Backend development is all about what happens behind the scenes. It ensures that data is correctly received, processed, and delivered between the frontend (user interface) and the database/server.

Key responsibilities of a backend developer include:
- Building APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)
- Managing database operations
- Ensuring security and authentication
- Writing business logic
- Deploying and maintaining servers`,

    section2: `üõ†Ô∏è Popular Backend Technologies

Backend developers use many different tools depending on the application‚Äôs needs. Some of the most popular ones include:

**Languages:**
- JavaScript (Node.js)
- Python (Django, Flask)
- PHP (Laravel)
- Java (Spring Boot)
- Ruby (Ruby on Rails)
- Go

**Databases:**
- SQL: MySQL, PostgreSQL
- NoSQL: MongoDB, Redis

**APIs & Tools:**
- REST & GraphQL APIs
- Authentication: JWT, OAuth
- Version control: Git & GitHub
- Server Hosting: Vercel, Railway, Heroku, AWS`,

    section3: `üöÄ Why Learn Backend Development?

- High demand in tech companies and startups
- Backbone of every scalable application
- Work with complex logic and data handling
- Essential for full stack development
- Great for creating secure and efficient systems

    subTitle: "Mastering Both Frontend and Backend Skills",
    para: `Full Stack Development refers to the practice of working on both the front-end (client side) and back-end (server side) of a web application. A full stack developer is someone who has the skills to build complete web applications, handling everything from the UI/UX to databases and server logic.`,

    section1: `üß± What is Full Stack Development?

Full stack development involves both:
- **Frontend Development**: Creating the visual interface using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frontend libraries/frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js.
- **Backend Development**: Handling server logic, databases, and APIs using languages like Node.js, Python, PHP, or Java.

Full stack developers understand how the entire system works and how the frontend interacts with the backend.`,

    section2: `‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used in Full Stack

Here are common tools and technologies full stack developers work with:

**Frontend:**
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Frameworks: React, Next.js, Vue, Angular
- Styling: Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap

**Backend:**
- Node.js, Express
- Python (Django, Flask)
- PHP, Laravel

**Database:**
- MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL

**Dev Tools:**
- Git, GitHub
- Docker
- CI/CD pipelines`,

    section3: `üöÄ Why Learn Full Stack Development?

- Build complete apps from start to finish
- High demand in startups and freelancing
- Understand project flow and team collaboration
